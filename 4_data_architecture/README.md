# Data Architecture Challenge

## Task

We are managing parking lots that a client can check with a mobile app. An app can tell the drive if a parking is full or not. On entering/leaving the parking a client can scan QR/NFC code on entrance machines and the cost must be automatically charged when leaving parking. We are interested in monitoring when the parking is full or empty to modify prices accordingly. We also would like to create a predictive model that learns when a client is going to the parking to send him a push message informing how many places are left or if the parking is full.

1. What tracking events would you propose? What data model for event analysis? What technologies?
2. How would you design the Backend system? What data model for the Operational system? What technologies?
3. Explain how to combine the operational architecture with the analytical one?
4. Could you propose a process to manage the development lifecycle? And the test and deployment automation?
